          I'm a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at SRM University with a passion for building and learning through technology. I enjoy exploring a range of domains—from web development to applied research—and continuously seek opportunities to turn ideas into real-world solutions. With a solid grounding in programming and problem-solving, I’m focused on developing practical skills that contribute to innovative and meaningful work.
